# CS300---Analysis-and-Design
The problem I was solving for the projects in this course was deciding which of three data storing and managing options are the best for storing and printing a class course list. I approached this problem by working with vectors, hashtables, and binary trees and comparing the three. Learning how each one worked and their strengths and weaknesses helped me understand the nature of the different data structures. Learning this is important because it allows one to become a stronger developer and create efficient code .
To overcome roadblocks I encountered on these projects, I utilized the many resources that was available to me, such as my textbook, videos, and coding forums. Sometimes taking a step back and returning with a fresh mind can also be helpful. Working on these projects helped me learn that code is more complex and requires thoughtfulness in design.
